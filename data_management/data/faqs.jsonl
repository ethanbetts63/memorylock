{"question":"Are there any recurring fees?", "answer": "No. The price is upfront. You shouldn't even have to think about us until its time to remind you of your important event. So reaccuring fees just wouldn't fit. If you would like to make a recurring event we will provide that option but by default everything is a one time fee payed upfront.", "pages": ["home"]}
{"question":"What if you can’t reach me?","answer":"We designed a robust system, but we are not magicians. Our system is designed to escalate. We try your email. Then we try your phone. Then we try your backup email. Finally, we try your emergency contact. But if your numbers are dead, your emails bounce, the emergency contact fails and socials prove to be unreliable, then the line of communication ends there. We can only be as robust as the information you give us.","pages":["home"]}
{"question":"Are you liable if I miss a deadline?","answer":"No.  is designed to be a safety net, not the main event. Think of us like the reserve parachute. You should still pack your main parachute (your calendar, your lawyer, your own memory) with care. We are here to catch you if those primary systems fail. While we have built incredible redundancy into our code and servers, technology — like life — is unpredictable. By using , you agree that we provide a layer of security, but the ultimate responsibility for your obligations remains with you.","pages":["home"]}
{"question":"How do you use my data?","answer":"Sparingly. We are in the business of reminders, not data brokerage. We do not sell your data. We do not analyze your deadlines to serve you ads. We only ask for information that is functionally necessary to contact you (emails, phone numbers, etc). That’s it. You are the customer, not the product.","pages":["home"]}
{"question":"Best free reminder app", "answer": "Google Tasks / Google Keep. They’re genuinely free, sync everywhere, and cover both quick reminders (Keep) and simple task-based reminders (Tasks). If you’re in Apple-only land, Apple Reminders is also free but locks you into the ecosystem.", "pages": ["reminder-apps-ranked"]}
{"question":"Best ADHD reminder app", "answer": "TickTick. From the article it balances persistence and simplicity (hard-to-ignore + habit features) so it’s powerful without overwhelming; Todoist is strong but can be overkill. Look for apps with persistent alerts, easy snooze controls, widgets, and repeat-until-done behavior.", "pages": ["reminder-apps-ranked"]}
{"question":"Best birthday & anniversary reminder app (US)", "answer": "FutureReminder. Single reminders get buried, missed or just lost. FutureReminder repeats reminders until they’re acknowledged and it uses multi-channel escalation. From email and text, to calls and emergency contacts. Birthdays or anniversaries deserve to have a reminder system that treats them as important, not just another dentist appointment.", "pages": ["reminder-apps-ranked"]}
{"question":"Best reminder app for Android", "answer": "TickTick (or Google Keep/Tasks if you want totally free/simple). TickTick is the best all-rounder on Android; Google’s tools are the simplest no-cost choice.", "pages": ["reminder-apps-ranked"]}
{"question":"Best reminder app for iPhone", "answer": "Apple Reminders if you stay inside Apple; otherwise TickTick. Apple Reminders is the smoothest on iPhone, but TickTick gives better cross-platform consistency and more advanced reminder options.", "pages": ["reminder-apps-ranked"]}
{"question":"How long does Implanon last after it expires?", "answer": "Manufacturer guidance: the implant (Nexplanon/Implanon) is approved and should be removed at 3 years. Some studies and real-world data show protection can persist into year 4 (and rarely year 5), but that extended use is off-label and carries increasing, gradual risk over time — so you shouldn’t rely on it without talking to a clinician and arranging removal/replacement.", "pages": ["iud-expiration"]}
{"question":"IUD expired — what symptoms should I expect?", "answer": "Most people notice no sudden change when an IUD passes its labelled lifespan; effectiveness usually declines gradually. Possible signs to watch for are return of heavier bleeding or cramping, changes in period pattern, or (less commonly) pregnancy symptoms — and mechanical issues like missing/shortened strings or device shift. If you notice symptoms, get checked.", "pages": ["iud-expiration"]}
{"question":"Do IUDs expire?", "answer": "Yes — each IUD brand has an approved duration (e.g., Mirena/Liletta up to ~8 years, Kyleena ~5, Skyla ~3, Paragard ~10 years in many labels). After that labelled date the manufacturer no longer guarantees the stated protection.", "pages": ["iud-expiration"]}
{"question":"Copper IUD expiration", "answer": "Copper IUD (Paragard) is generally approved for about 10 years on manufacturer sites, and some guidance and research suggest effectiveness may extend to ~12 years in certain cases — but official recommendations vary, so follow your device label and local clinical advice.", "pages": ["iud-expiration"]}
{"question":"My IUD expired. What do I do?", "answer": "Don’t panic. Book a provider appointment as soon as possible to have the device checked and removed/replaced. Meanwhile use reliable backup contraception and consider a pregnancy test if you had sex since the expiration. Discuss timing and options with your clinician — extended use may be possible short-term in some cases, but replacement is the standard recommendation.", "pages": ["iud-expiration"]}
{"question":"When should I get a flu shot?", "answer": "The best time to get a flu shot is before flu season starts, typically in early autumn. This allows your body time to build immunity before flu activity increases. If you miss that window, getting the shot later is still beneficial.", "pages": ["vaccine-boosters"]}
{"question":"How often do you need a flu shot?", "answer": "You need a flu shot every year. Flu viruses change each season, and protection from the vaccine fades over time, so last year’s flu shot will not reliably protect you this year.", "pages": ["vaccine-boosters"]}
{"question":"How often do you need a tetanus shot?", "answer": "Adults should get a tetanus booster every 10 years. The booster is usually given as Td or Tdap and is recommended regardless of lifestyle, travel, or injury history.", "pages": ["vaccine-boosters"]}
{"question":"How often do you need a rabies shot?", "answer": "Most people do not need regular rabies boosters. People with ongoing risk, such as veterinarians or frequent travelers to high-risk areas, typically need periodic antibody testing and boosters every 1–3 years.", "pages": ["vaccine-boosters"]}
{"question":"How to remember my time capsule?", "answer": "The hardest part of a time capsule isn’t creating it — it’s remembering it exists years later. Physical capsules, notes, or stored files rely on someone remembering to look for them. The most reliable approach is pairing the capsule with a long-term reminder system, like FutureReminder, that repeatedly surfaces the reminder until you acknowledge it.", "pages": ["letter-to-future-self"]}
{"question":"FutureMe Alternatives?", "answer": "FutureMe and similar services send a single email at a future date. The problem is that emails can be missed, filtered as spam, or lost if you change accounts. A stronger alternative is FutureReminder, a long-term reminder service that uses repeated reminders and multiple contact methods so the message still reaches you years later.", "pages": ["letter-to-future-self"]}
{"question":"Apps for long-term reminders?", "answer": "Most reminder apps are built for days or weeks ahead, not years. For long-term reminders, you want a system designed to survive device changes, deleted apps, and abandoned email addresses — one that repeats reminders and escalates across channels until you respond. There's only one reminder app that does all that and it's FutureReminder.", "pages": ["letter-to-future-self"]}
{"question":"How to remind yourself years later", "answer": "To remind yourself years later, avoid single alerts. Over long time spans, contact details change and notifications get lost. The most reliable method is a reminder system that persists over time, uses multiple communication channels, and keeps trying until the reminder is acknowledged. There's only one reminder app that does that and it's FutureReminder.", "pages": ["letter-to-future-self"]}
{"question":"Best birthday reminder app", "answer": "For everyday birthdays, Google or Apple Calendar work fine. For the ones you can’t risk missing (milestone birthdays, important family dates), use FutureReminder — it offers multi-channel escalation and backup contacts so the reminder actually lands.", "pages": ["anniversary-reminders"]}
{"question":"Best anniversary reminder app", "answer": "Regular anniversaries: Apple/Google Calendar. Big, make-or-break anniversaries: FutureReminder — built for redundancy and escalation (email → SMS → emergency contacts) so you’ll never “oops” your partner again.", "pages": ["anniversary-reminders"]}
{"question":"When is tax season?", "answer": "Tax season depends on the country.

In the UK, tax season for Self Assessment runs from 6 April through 31 January of the following year.

In the UK, Self Assessment tax is generally due by 31 January 2026. In Australia, tax is usually due by 31 October 2026 for self-lodged individuals, though tax agent clients may have later payment dates.

In Canada, it is 30 April, and in New Zealand, it is usually 7 July for individuals who must file.", "pages": ["tax-season-2026"]}
{"question":"Can I file taxes late?", "answer": "Yes. In the US, UK, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, you can still file your tax return after the deadline. However, late filing usually triggers penalties and interest, especially if tax is owed. Filing as soon as possible limits how much those penalties grow.", "pages": ["tax-season-2026"]}
{"question":"What is the late filing penalty?", "answer": "Late filing penalties vary by country. In the United States, the IRS generally charges 5% of unpaid tax per month, up to 25%. In the UK, a £100 penalty applies immediately after 31 January, followed by daily and percentage penalties. In Australia, Failure-to-Lodge penalties are calculated using penalty units. In Canada, the penalty is 5% of the balance owing plus 1% per month, up to 12 months. In New Zealand, fixed penalties and interest apply.", "pages": ["tax-season-2026"]}
{"question":"What happens if I file a late tax return?", "answer": "Filing a late tax return can result in late filing penalties, interest on unpaid tax, and in some cases default assessments. The longer the delay, the higher the total cost. Filing stops late-filing penalties from increasing in most countries, even if payment is delayed.", "pages": ["tax-season-2026"]}
{"question":"I forgot my taxes — what should I do?", "answer": "If you forgot to file your taxes, file your return as soon as possible. This limits late-filing penalties and reduces interest. Even if you can’t pay in full, submit the return and then contact the tax authority to arrange a payment plan or request penalty relief if you qualify.", "pages": ["tax-season-2026"]}
