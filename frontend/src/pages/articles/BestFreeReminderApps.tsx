We’re simply fascinated by reminder apps—how they work, where they fail, and why people rely on them. If you’re looking for reminders targeting important events and/or events years into the future, our homepage has that covered. But if you just want a solid free app for everyday life, this ranking is for you.</>}

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-0">How We Ranked These Free Apps</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">We spent time testing the most popular free reminder apps and cross-checked our findings with what real users say online. The goal wasn’t to crown the shiniest brand, but to see which apps are dependable without charging a dollar. We evaluated core features—notifications, recurring schedules, platform support, syncing, and limitations hidden behind paywalls—to separate useful tools from frustrating bait-and-switch designs.</p>

          {/* Ranking Section */}
          <div className="space-y-12">
            {/* 5. Desktop Reminder */}
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 border-b pb-2">5. Desktop Reminder — Simple, desktop-first (Windows only)</h3>
              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-4 mb-4">
                <p><strong>Cross-platform sync:</strong> 1/5</p>
                <p><strong>Hard-to-ignore:</strong> 3/5</p>
                <p><strong>Ease & aesthetics:</strong> 3/5</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 5/5</p>
                <p><strong>Featurefulness:</strong> 2/5</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> Users who run a Windows PC love its no-friction, always-on desktop alerts and the year-view calendar. Complaints: it’s Windows-only and feels old-school.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> If you live at a single Windows machine and want a dead-simple, free desktop alarm calendar, Desktop Reminder does the job. Don’t pick it if you need mobile or cloud sync.</p>
            </div>

            {/* 4. Remember The Milk */}
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 border-b pb-2">4. Remember The Milk — Lightweight, with old-school power</h3>
              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-4 mb-4">
                <p><strong>Cross-platform sync:</strong> 4/5</p>
                <p><strong>Hard-to-ignore:</strong> 3/5</p>
                <p><strong>Ease & aesthetics:</strong> 3/5</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 4/5</p>
                <p><strong>Featurefulness:</strong> 3/5</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> Long-time users praise its reliability, tagging, and flexible notifications (email/SMS integrations). Newer users sometimes find the UI dated compared with modern apps.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> RTM is great if you want a focused list manager with smart tags and multiple notification channels. The free tier covers basics; power users may want Pro for extra integrations.</p>
            </div>

            {/* 3. Microsoft To Do */}
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 border-b pb-2">3. Microsoft To Do — Safe, integrated (especially for Outlook/Windows users)</h3>
              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-4 mb-4">
                <p><strong>Cross-platform sync:</strong> 4/5</p>

                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 5/5</p>
                <p><strong>Featurefulness:</strong> 3/5</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> Described as “good enough” — solid syncing with Microsoft 365 and zero cost. Criticisms: feature set is basic compared with modern task powerhouses.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> Choose Microsoft To Do if you live in Microsoft’s ecosystem and want predictable, free reminders that just work. It’s stable and clean but intentionally simple. The key to this recommendation is the “if you live in Microsoft’s ecosystem”. If you don’t it would be a crazy option to choose.</p>
            </div>

            {/* 2. Google Keep / Google Tasks */}
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 border-b pb-2">2. Google Keep / Google Tasks — Frictionless, everywhere-you-already-are reminders</h3>
              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-4 mb-4">
                <p><strong>Cross-platform sync:</strong> 5/5</p>

                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 5/5</p>
                <p><strong>Featurefulness:</strong> 3/5</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> People call them “shockingly convenient” — they show up in Gmail, Android, and the web instantly. The tradeoff: they’re intentionally simple and not for complex workflows.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> If you want zero-thought reminders that sync flawlessly across devices, Google’s tools are hard to beat. They lack power features and strong nagging, but that’s the point. To quote Terry Davis; "An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity."</p>

            {/* 1. TickTick */}
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 border-b pb-2">1. TickTick — Best free + optionally-powerful balance (our top free pick)</h3>
              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-4 mb-4">
                <p><strong>Cross-platform sync:</strong> 5/5</p>
                <p><strong>Hard-to-ignore:</strong> 4/5</p>

                <p><strong>Featurefulness:</strong> 5/5</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> TickTick consistently gets praised for flexible recurring rules, habit tracking, fast UI, and multi-platform reliability. The free tier is generous; premium unlocks advanced features.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> TickTick wins for the free category because it balances great cross-device sync, strong reminders (including repeat/annoying options), and a rich feature set — without feeling cluttered. For most people who want a single, free app that can scale, this is the best bet. Ironically, it's not completely free. But we think the free tier gives enough value that it still wins.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-12">Honourable Mention: FutureReminder</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">FutureReminder isn’t meant to replace everyday free reminder apps. Those are great for quick, frequent tasks—but they usually fail when a reminder matters months or years down the line.</p>
          <p className="mb-6">We specialize in rare, high-stakes events. Think <Link to="/articles/visa-expiry" className="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-primary">visa expirations</Link>, warranty deadlines, domain renewals, or <Link to="/articles/anniversary-reminders" className="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-primary">major anniversaries</Link>. We escalate reminders via email, SMS, backup contacts, emergency contacts, and even social media if necessary. Unlike regular apps that send a single notification, we persistently remind you until the task is confirmed. Over long timeframes, contact info changes, so multiple channels are essential. And our free tier is generous, including both email and text reminders for trying it risk-free.</p>
