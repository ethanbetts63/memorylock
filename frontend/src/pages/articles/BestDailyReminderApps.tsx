          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-0">Why Daily Reminder Apps Matter</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">A good daily reminder system keeps tasks visible, interruptions minimal, and repetition effortless. But not all apps handle recurring reminders equally well—some lack flexible schedules, others send unreliable notifications, and many hide essentials behind paywalls. In this guide, we break down which apps perform best for day-to-day use based on reliability, ease of setup, customization, and how well they help habits stick over time.</p>

            {/* 5. Twobird */}
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 border-b pb-2">5. Twobird — Email-centred daily reminder + inbox</h3>
              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-4 mb-4">
                <p><strong>Cross-platform sync:</strong> 4/5</p>
                <p><strong>Hard-to-ignore:</strong> 2/5</p>
                <p><strong>Ease & aesthetics:</strong> 4/5</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 5/5</p>
                <p><strong>Featurefulness:</strong> 3/5</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> Twobird gets love for treating your inbox like a task list — pin, snooze, and integrate notes and reminders with email. Some people feel it’s more of an email client than a pure reminder system.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> Great if your daily life revolves around email. It’s free and frictionless, but the reminder strength is average (it uses standard notifications via email/app). Not ideal if you want persistent alerts beyond your inbox.</p>
            </div>

            {/* 4. Capsicum */}
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 border-b pb-2">4. Capsicum — Smart daily planner (iOS only)</h3>
              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-4 mb-4">
                <p><strong>Cross-platform sync:</strong> 2/5</p>
                <p><strong>Hard-to-ignore:</strong> 3/5</p>
                <p><strong>Ease & aesthetics:</strong> 4/5</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 4/5</p>
                <p><strong>Featurefulness:</strong> 3/5</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> Users praise Capsicum’s “Today/Upcoming” separation and AI-guided task suggestions. Concern: no Android or web, so sync outside iOS is weak.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> Well-designed and helpful for daily routines on iPhone, but limited platforms pull it down. Use it if you’re fully on Apple devices and want a calmer daily planner.</p>
            </div>

            {/* 3. Things 3 */}
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 border-b pb-2">3. Things 3 — Beautiful daily task & reminder hub</h3>
              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-4 mb-4">
                <p><strong>Cross-platform sync:</strong> 3/5</p>
                <p><strong>Hard-to-ignore:</strong> 3/5</p>
                <p><strong>Ease & aesthetics:</strong> 5/5</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 2/5</p>
                <p><strong>Featurefulness:</strong> 4/5</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> Things 3 often gets mentioned first in Apple-centric “daily task” threads — people love its clean UI and flow. Downsides: expensive per platform and no Android.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> If you adore aesthetics and daily planning clarity, Things 3 is gorgeous and satisfying. It’s less persistent with alerts than some, and isn’t great outside iOS/macOS.</p>
            </div>

            {/* 2. Due */}
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 border-b pb-2">2. Due — Nagging daily reminders until you act</h3>
              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-4 mb-4">
                <p><strong>Cross-platform sync:</strong> 1/5</p>
                <p><strong>Hard-to-ignore:</strong> 5/5</p>
                <p><strong>Ease & aesthetics:</strong> 3/5</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 3/5</p>
                <p><strong>Featurefulness:</strong> 2/5</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> People swear by Due for persistent daily reminders — it won’t stop alerting until you check tasks off. The complaint: no cloud sync and a very simple feature set.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> If your biggest problem is forgetting daily tasks (e.g., “won’t snooze forever”), Due is ruthless in a good way. But it’s iOS/macOS only and very focused (no tags, lists, web, etc.), which limits broader utility.</p>
            </div>

            {/* 1. Todoist */}
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 border-b pb-2">1. Todoist — Daily routines + flexible recurring power</h3>
              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-4 mb-4">
                <p><strong>Cross-platform sync:</strong> 5/5</p>
                <p><strong>Hard-to-ignore:</strong> 3/5</p>
                <p><strong>Ease & aesthetics:</strong> 4/5</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 3/5</p>
                <p><strong>Featurefulness:</strong> 5/5</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> Todoist shows up again and again in productivity forums for daily habit tracking and recurring tasks. Users love the natural language recurrence (“every day at 8am”), integrations (calendar, Slack, etc.), and reliability across devices. Critiques: some push that it’s more of a task manager than a pure reminder app.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> Todoist wins this category because it blends strong recurring reminders with cross-device consistency and a feature set that scales from simple daily tasks to full habits and workflows. It isn’t the strongest nagging tool, but for structured daily reminders it’s hard to beat.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-12">Honourable Mention: FutureReminder</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Daily reminder apps are perfect for routines, habits, and short-term recurring tasks. FutureReminder isn’t meant for morning alarms or daily chores.</p>
          <p className="mb-6">We shine for once-in-a-lifetime or critical events months or years away. Use cases include visa expirations, major legal deadlines, or life milestones like anniversaries. We escalate via email, SMS, backup contacts, emergency contacts, and social media. Persistence is key: unlike regular apps that send one notification, we continue until the reminder is confirmed. Contact info changes over long periods, so multiple channels are essential. Our free tier includes both email and text reminders, letting you secure critical events at no cost.</p>
