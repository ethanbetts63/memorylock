Futurereminder Email System Setup

Purpose: Reliable, low-volume transactional email for high-consequence user reminders (IUD removals, patent renewals, warranty expirations, etc.).

1. Email Provider

Service chosen: Amazon SES (Simple Email Service)

Region: EU-NORTH-1 (closest major AWS region; fully global delivery)

Rationale: Extremely reliable, low cost, designed for transactional emails, handles retries/bounces automatically, scales if needed.

2. Sending Domain

Domain used: futurereminder.app

From address: reminders@futurereminder.app

Verified identities: Domain verified in SES

DKIM setup: 3 CNAME records added to Cloudflare

SPF setup: TXT record v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all added to Cloudflare

MAIL FROM: default (SES managed)

Dedicated IP: not used (shared pool)

Tenant management: default/off

3. Sandbox and Production

Initial testing: SES sandbox

Can only send to verified recipients

Verified Gmail address used for testing

Production access requested: Transactional emails only

Low expected volume (<100 emails/day)

Explicit user consent

Bounces/complaints handled via suppression list

4. Django Integration

Settings (settings.py):

EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend"
EMAIL_HOST = "email-smtp.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com"
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get("SES_SMTP_USER")
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get("SES_SMTP_PASS")
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = "FutureReminder <reminders@futurereminder.app>"


Test snippet:

from django.core.mail import send_mail

send_mail(
    subject="Test Reminder",
    message="This is a test email from SES sandbox.",
    from_email="FutureReminder <reminders@futurereminder.app>",
    recipient_list=["yourverifiedemail@gmail.com"],
    fail_silently=False,
)


Logs SES response

Confirms deliverability before moving out of sandbox

5. Key Notes / Best Practices

Emails are transactional, not marketing

All recipients explicitly opt in

Bounce/complaint monitoring planned (SNS + suppression list)

Reply-To can later point to a real support mailbox (e.g., support@futurereminder.app)

SPF, DKIM, and optional DMARC improve deliverability and trust

This setup ensures cost-effective, reliable, and compliant email delivery for Futurereminder’s critical reminder system.
