# FutureReminder

Calendar apps are for meetings. FutureReminder is for consequences. Single reminders get buried, missed or just lost. FutureReminder repeats reminders until they’re acknowledged and it uses multi-channel escalation. From email and text, to calls and emergency contacts. High stakes deadlines such as visa or IUD expiries, trademark or domain renewals and even warranties, patents or business licences, deserve to have a reminder system that treats them as life and death, not just another dentist appointment. So check out FutureReminder today, and find out how it feels to offload the “don’t forget” part of your brain, once and for all.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Django, Django Rest Framework
*   **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **Database:** MySQL
*   **Payments:** Stripe
*   **Email:** Mailgun
*   **Messaging:** Twilio
*   **Testing:** Pytest

## Core Backend Concepts

The Django project is organized into several applications:

*   `users`: Manages the custom user model, authentication, and user profile data including emergency contacts.
*   `events`: Handles the creation, management, and scheduling of reminder events and their associated notifications.
*   `payments`: Integrates with Stripe to process payments for different service tiers.
*   `data_management`: Manages static and semi-static content like FAQs and Terms & Conditions.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up a local development environment.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   Node.js 20.x+
*   MySQL server

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd futurereminder
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/Scripts/activate  # On Windows
    # source venv/bin/activate    # On macOS/Linux
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root directory. This file stores sensitive configuration.
    ```env
    # Django Settings
    SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
    DEBUG=True
    HASHING_SALT=your_hashing_salt

    # Database Settings
    DB_NAME=futurereminder_db
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_PORT=3306

    # API/Service Keys
    STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
    MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_api_key
    MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your_mailgun_domain

    # The base URL of the server, used for creating absolute URLs
    API_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
    ```

5.  **Run database migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  **Create a superuser (optional):**
    This allows you to access the Django admin interface.
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

7.  **Run the backend development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The backend will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use). The Vite dev server is configured to proxy API requests to the backend.

## Running Tests

To run the backend test suite, execute the following command from the project root:

```bash
pytest
```
The tests are configured via the `pytest.ini` file.

## Development Utilities

### Database Reset (Windows PowerShell)

The project includes a PowerShell script `reset_django.ps1` to completely reset the local development environment. This is useful if your local database schema is out of sync or you want to start from a clean slate.

**Warning:** This is a destructive operation. It will delete all data in your local database.

To run the script:

```powershell
.\reset_django.ps1
```

The script performs the following actions:
1.  Prompts you to manually drop and recreate the MySQL database.
2.  Deletes all `__pycache__` directories and old migration files.
3.  Creates new database migrations.
4.  Applies the migrations.
5.  Runs several custom management commands to populate the database with initial data.

### Custom Management Commands

The project includes several custom Django management commands to help with development:

*   `python manage.py generate --faqs`: Populates the database with FAQ data.
*   `python manage.py generate --tiers`: Populates the database with pricing tier data.
*   `python manage.py generate --terms`: Populates the database with the latest terms and conditions.
*   `python manage.py fix_site_domains`: Corrects the domain name in the Django Sites framework, which is useful for local development.

You can run these commands individually after setting up the project.
