          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-0">How We Evaluated These Medication Reminder Tools</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">We compared medication apps based on reliability, persistence, schedule flexibility, platform support, and whether the free tier is actually usable for long-term adherence. Features like refill alerts, confirmation prompts, and caregiver support were weighed more heavily than design flourishes or habit-tracking extras.</p>

          {/* Ranking Section */}
          <div className="space-y-12">
            {/* 5. GoodRx Medicine Cabinet */}
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 border-b pb-2">5. GoodRx Medicine Cabinet — Simple, free, and refill-focused</h3>
              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-4 mb-4">
                <p><strong>Cross-platform sync:</strong> 4/5</p>
                <p><strong>Hard-to-ignore:</strong> 3/5</p>
                <p><strong>Ease & aesthetics:</strong> 4/5</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 5/5</p>
                <p><strong>Featurefulness:</strong> 3/5</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> People mainly use GoodRx for discounts, but are pleasantly surprised by the built-in medication reminders. It handles refills well, but isn’t designed for complex dosing schedules.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> A great free option if your needs are basic: “take this pill” and “refill soon.” It’s not aggressive enough for critical meds, but solid as a lightweight solution.</p>
            </div>

            {/* 4. Dosecast */}
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 border-b pb-2">4. Dosecast — Strong scheduling, locked behind paywalls</h3>
              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-4 mb-4">
                <p><strong>Cross-platform sync:</strong> 4/5</p>
                <p><strong>Hard-to-ignore:</strong> 4/5</p>
                <p><strong>Ease & aesthetics:</strong> 3/5</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 3/5</p>
                <p><strong>Featurefulness:</strong> 4/5</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> Users like Dosecast’s ability to handle weird schedules (every X hours, rotating days, etc.). The biggest complaint is that syncing and advanced features require paid plans.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> Dosecast is very capable for complex medication routines, but the free tier feels constrained. Good choice if your schedule is non-standard — less ideal if you want everything free.</p>
            </div>

            {/* 3. Pillo */}
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 border-b pb-2">3. Pillo — Extremely persistent (Android only)</h3>
              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-4 mb-4">
                <p><strong>Cross-platform sync:</strong> 1/5</p>
                <p><strong>Hard-to-ignore:</strong> 5/5</p>
                <p><strong>Ease & aesthetics:</strong> 3/5</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 5/5</p>
                <p><strong>Featurefulness:</strong> 3/5</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> People love (and sometimes hate) how impossible it is to ignore Pillo. It keeps alerting until you explicitly confirm you took the medication. Main downside: Android-only.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> If your biggest problem is ignoring reminders, Pillo is ruthless — in a good way. Platform lock-in holds it back, but persistence-wise, it’s one of the strongest apps available.</p>
            </div>

            {/* 2. MyTherapy */}
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 border-b pb-2">2. MyTherapy — Best free medical-grade reminder</h3>
              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-4 mb-4">
                <p><strong>Cross-platform sync:</strong> 4/5</p>
                <p><strong>Hard-to-ignore:</strong> 4/5</p>
                <p><strong>Ease & aesthetics:</strong> 4/5</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 5/5</p>
                <p><strong>Featurefulness:</strong> 4/5</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> Frequently recommended by healthcare workers and patients alike. People trust it for long-term medication adherence and appreciate refill warnings and health tracking.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> MyTherapy punches way above its weight for a free app. Strong reminders, sensible UX, and no obvious monetisation pressure. For many people, this is all they’ll ever need.</p>
            </div>

            {/* 1. Medisafe */}
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 border-b pb-2">1. Medisafe — The gold standard for medication reminders</h3>
              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-4 mb-4">
                <p><strong>Cross-platform sync:</strong> 5/5</p>
                <p><strong>Hard-to-ignore:</strong> 5/5</p>
                <p><strong>Ease & aesthetics:</strong> 4/5</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 4/5</p>
                <p><strong>Featurefulness:</strong> 5/5</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> Medisafe is consistently the most recommended medication reminder app. Users praise its reliability, refill alerts, caregiver syncing, and interaction warnings. Complaints mostly relate to premium upsells.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> Medisafe wins because it treats medication reminders as mission-critical, not just notifications. It’s persistent, cross-platform, and designed for real-world adherence — not just ticking boxes. If forgetting meds has real consequences, this is the safest mainstream choice.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-12">Honourable Mention: FutureReminder (That’s Us)</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">We’ll be upfront: if your main concern is taking pills on time, FutureReminder is not the app you need. There are specialized medication apps that handle persistence, recurring dosing, and healthcare requirements far better than we could.</p>
          <p className="mb-6">Where we shine is in the type of reminders that most apps don’t even attempt: those super important, long-term events you can’t afford to forget. Think things like: <Link to="/articles/visa-expiry" className="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-primary">visa expirations</Link>, business license renewals, warranty deadlines, <Link to="/articles/anniversary-reminders" className="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-primary">anniversary dates</Link>, or any rare-but-critical personal events that happen months or years from now.</p>
          <p className="mb-6">We don’t just rely on a push notification. FutureReminder will reach out via email, SMS, backup contacts, and even phone calls if necessary. You can designate emergency contacts, and in extreme cases, we can reach out manually through social channels. Overkill? Maybe—but missing these types of reminders can have serious consequences.</p>
          <p className="mb-6">In short: medication apps handle the day-to-day dosing. FutureReminder handles the once-in-a-lifetime, critical-to-remember events. If you’ve got something that truly cannot slip through the cracks, we’re the service built for that.</p>
