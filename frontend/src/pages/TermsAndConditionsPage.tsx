                <p>Last updated: 12/12/2025</p>
                <p>
                    These Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the reminder notification service (“FutureReminder”). By creating an account, submitting contact information, or scheduling an event, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the Service.
                </p>

                <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>“Service”</strong> means the reminder notification system that delivers scheduled notifications using the contact methods you provide.</li>
                    <li><strong>“Event”</strong> means any reminder, notification, deadline, appointment, or other item created by the user.</li>
                    <li><strong>“User Content”</strong> means all information provided by the user, including event dates, times, descriptions, time zones, contact information, and emergency contacts.</li>
                    <li><strong>“Emergency Contact”</strong> means any person the user designates to receive notifications if escalation occurs.</li>
                    <li><strong>“Contact Methods”</strong> include email addresses, phone numbers, SMS-compatible numbers, backup contact numbers, social media accounts, or any additional communication channels provided by the user.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Product Description & Service</h2>
                <h3>1. Nature of the Service</h3>
                <p>Our service provides users with an additional layer of notification support for important future events (“Events”). Using the contact information supplied by the user, our system schedules and sends a series of reminder notifications across multiple communication channels. These channels may include, but are not limited to: email, SMS, backup emails, backup SMS numbers, social media accounts, phone calls, and designated emergency contacts.</p>
                <p>The service is intended to assist users in remembering important dates. It does not replace the user’s own responsibility to track or attend the Event.</p>

                <h3>2. Operation of Notification System</h3>
                <p>When creating an Event, the user selects a time period before the Event during which notifications will begin (“Notification Window”). The system automatically divides this period into a series of time blocks and, based on those blocks, attempts to deliver notifications through the available channels.</p>
                <p>The escalation of communication methods is automated and follows a general hierarchy. However, the exact timing, sequence, and channels used may vary based on system performance, availability of communication platforms, and the completeness or accuracy of the user’s provided contact information.</p>

                <h3>3. No Guarantee of Delivery or Receipt</h3>
                <p>While we make commercially reasonable efforts to send notifications according to the user’s settings, we do not guarantee that any notification will be delivered, received, read, acted upon, or successfully reach the intended recipient.</p>
                <p>Delivery may fail or be delayed due to factors outside our control, including but not limited to carrier limitations, spam filters, API failures, platform restrictions, user device settings, service outages, incorrect or outdated contact information, or actions taken by third-party platforms.</p>

                <h3>4. User Responsibility</h3>
                <p>The user remains fully responsible for attending, complying with, or otherwise managing their Event and its associated obligations. Our service is an optional support tool only.</p>
                <p>We accept no liability for any missed deadlines, appointments, obligations, legal requirements, fees, penalties, or damages arising from missed Events, whether or not notifications were sent or received.</p>
                
                <h3>5. Emergency Contacts</h3>
                <p>If the user provides emergency contact information, the user represents and warrants that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(a) the emergency contacts have given their explicit consent to be contacted on the user’s behalf; and</li>
                    <li>(b) the user accepts all responsibility for any consequences of such contact.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We may contact emergency contacts only as part of the notification escalation process, and only using the details the user has supplied.</p>
                
                <h3>6. Scope & Limitations</h3>
                <p>The service does not verify the nature, accuracy, legality, or consequences of any Event. We are not a legal reminder service, medical reminder service, compliance service, financial planning tool, or safety-critical system.</p>
                <p>The user must not rely on this service as their sole or primary method of remembering or acting upon an Event.</p>

                <h3>4. Consent to Escalation and Emergency Contact Notifications</h3>
                <p>By scheduling an Event, the user authorises the Service to escalate contact attempts using additional methods if earlier attempts fail.</p>
                <p>Escalation may include contacting:</p>
                <ul>
