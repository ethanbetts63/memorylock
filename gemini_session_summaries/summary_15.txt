This session focused on decentralizing the `api` app by moving its functionality into other existing apps.

The following steps were taken:

1.  **URL Decentralization:**
    *   The URL patterns from `api/urls.py` were moved to the `urls.py` files of the `users`, `events`, `data_management`, `notifications`, and `payments` apps.
    *   The main `futurereminder/urls.py` file was updated to include the new URL files for `events` and `notifications`, and the include for `api.urls` was removed.

2.  **Import Path Updates:**
    *   The import paths in the views of the `events`, `data_management`, and `notifications` apps were updated to use absolute imports, reflecting the new locations of the serializers.

3.  **Error Resolution:**
    *   An `ModuleNotFoundError` in `payments/urls.py` was resolved by correcting the import path for the payment views.

4.  **`INSTALLED_APPS` Update:**
    *   The `api` app was removed from the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `futurereminder/settings.py`.

Throughout the session, there was some confusion about whether to delete the `api` app and its files. The final decision was to leave the `api` app directory and its files in place, but to remove its functionality from the project. This was done to allow for a gradual and reversible decentralization process.
