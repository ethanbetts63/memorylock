          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-0">When should you prune cherry trees?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Cherry trees are best pruned in late winter to early spring before new growth begins—but once the harshest frost risk has passed. This reduces the chance of disease entering fresh cuts. Fruiting cherries benefit from annual light pruning to open the canopy, improving airflow and reducing disease pressure.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">When should you trim cherry trees?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Trimming focuses on light shaping and the removal of water sprouts, suckers, or crossing branches. This can be done during active growth but should be limited to small corrections to avoid excessive stress and sap flow. Remove only small amounts at a time.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">When should you fertilize cherry trees?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Apply fertilizer in early spring just as buds break. Use a balanced, slow‑release fertilizer formulated for fruiting trees. Over‑fertilizing drives leafy growth rather than flowers or fruit and increases risk of disease. Mature trees in fertile soils may need little to no supplemental feeding.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune cherry trees in spring?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Yes—late winter to early spring is the primary pruning window. Focus on thinning crowded branches, removing damaged wood, and improving structure. Avoid removing flower buds unless necessary for disease control or cross‑branching reduction.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune cherry trees in summer?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Summer pruning is optional and should be minimal. Removing water sprouts or small crossing branches after harvest (for fruiting varieties) is acceptable. Avoid heavy cuts during hot, dry periods when stress and sap flow are high.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune cherry trees in autumn (fall)?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Avoid pruning in autumn. Cherries are prone to disease entry through cuts, and fall moisture increases that risk. Late pruning also stimulates tender regrowth vulnerable to winter damage. Leave shaping until spring.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune cherry trees in winter?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Late winter pruning is safe once severe frost risk passes. Avoid cutting during deep cold snaps, which increase die‑back and disease vulnerability. Winter pruning should focus on structural corrections, removing dead/diseased wood, and thinning for airflow.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Caring for cherry trees? The most common mistake</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">One of the most common mistakes with cherry tree care is timing — people plan to prune, feed or protect their cherry trees, then life gets in the way and the window closes. You probably saw this coming. FutureReminder exists to solve that problem: our free tier is perfect for these sorts of gardening reminder needs. Why not just use your calender app? You definitely could. But a single notification is easy to miss. And what if you change phones? We use a notification hierarchy. We’ll start with emails, then we’ll send you texts. And we’ll keep trying to reach out until you acknowledge us. So that’s the pitch, nothing too complicated. We’d love for you to give it a try. And so would your cherry trees’s.
