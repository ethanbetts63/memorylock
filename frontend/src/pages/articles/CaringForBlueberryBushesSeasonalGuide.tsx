          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-0">When should you prune blueberry bushes?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Prune blueberries during late winter while the plants are fully dormant (typically late winter to very early spring). Remove the oldest canes at the base to encourage vigorous new shoots — most growers remove about 10–30% of the oldest wood each year. Avoid heavy pruning in autumn or early winter, which can stimulate tender regrowth vulnerable to frost.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">When should you trim blueberry bushes?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Trimming is mostly corrective and can be done lightly during the growing season to remove water sprouts or to shape young plants. After harvest, you can remove broken or diseased wood, but save major cuts for the dormant pruning window. For overgrown plants, gradual rejuvenation over several seasons is safer than a single drastic cut.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">When should you fertilize blueberry bushes?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Blueberries prefer low‑pH soils (about 4.5–5.5) and benefit from applications of fertilizers formulated for acid‑loving plants (azalea/ericaceous feeds) in early spring and again in late spring if needed. Avoid high rates of nitrogen; instead use small, frequent feeds or controlled‑release formulas. Amend with acid organic matter (pine needles, peat, composted bark) and mulch to maintain acidity and soil structure.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune blueberry bushes in spring?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Yes — late winter to very early spring (before bud swell) is the best time for major pruning. This timing minimizes sap loss and makes it easy to see which canes are dead or weak. If you miss this window, avoid cutting after new growth starts because you’ll remove potential fruiting wood.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune blueberry bushes in summer?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Summer pruning should be light and targeted: remove vigorous water sprouts, thin crowded growth slightly, and take out any diseased or dead branches. Avoid heavy summer cuts, which can reduce next year’s bud formation and stress the plant during fruit production.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune blueberry bushes in autumn (fall)?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Avoid autumn pruning. Cuts made in fall can trigger late-season growth that won’t harden off before cold weather, increasing winter injury. Only remove clearly dead or damaged wood; leave structural pruning to the dormant season.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune blueberry bushes in winter?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Late winter dormant pruning is ideal. Prune on a mild day when plants are fully dormant but before sap flow begins. Remove oldest canes at the base, thin to maintain 6–8 strong canes per mature bush, and cut out weak, twiggy growth. Avoid pruning in deep freeze.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Caring for blueberry bushes? The most common mistake</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">One of the most common mistakes with blueberry bush care is timing — people plan to prune, feed or protect their blueberry bushes, then life gets in the way and the window closes. You probably saw this coming. FutureReminder exists to solve that problem: our <Link to="/articles/best-free-reminder-apps" className="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-primary">free tier</Link> is perfect for these sorts of gardening reminder needs. Why not just use your calender app? You definitely could. But a single notification is easy to miss. And what if you change phones? We use a notification hierarchy. We’ll start with <Link to="/articles/best-email-reminder-apps" className="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-primary">emails</Link>, then we’ll send you <Link to="/articles/best-text-message-reminder-apps" className="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-primary">texts</Link>. And we’ll keep trying to reach out until you acknowledge us. So that’s the pitch, nothing too complicated. We’d love for you to give it a try. And so would your blueberry bushes’s.
