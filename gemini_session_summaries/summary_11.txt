This session focused on resolving frontend issues, implementing a new feature on the event management page, and discussing persistent npm dependency problems.

The session began with fixing a 404 error on the `/api/tiers/` endpoint. I split the `tier_serializer.py` into two files (`price_serializer.py` and `tier_serializer.py`) as suggested and corrected an import path in the corresponding view, which resolved the issue.

Following this, we addressed two problems on the payment page: an incorrect price display ($0.00) and a minor styling glitch (a double horizontal line). This was resolved by refactoring the `Summary.tsx` component to accept a direct `price` prop instead of a complex configuration object and updating the parent pages (`TierChoicePage` and `PaymentPage`) to pass the correct price from the selected tier. A subsequent bug where the price showed as "N/A" was traced to a string-vs-number type mismatch, which was also fixed. During this process, we had a discussion about how Stripe pricing works, clarifying that our backend is responsible for telling Stripe the final amount to charge.

The main feature implementation was on the `EventManagementPage.tsx`. The goal was to display each event's tier and add an "Upgrade" button for events on the free plan. This involved:
1.  Updating the backend `EventSerializer` to include the event's `tier` information.
2.  Updating the frontend `Event` type definition.
3.  Modifying the `EventManagementPage` component to display the tier and a conditional "Upgrade" button that navigates users to the payment page for the paid tier.
4.  Styling the "Upgrade" button to be green as a final polish.

Finally, we addressed recurring `npm` dependency errors. An initial `ERESOLVE` error was discussed, with the solution being to set `npm config set legacy-peer-deps true`. When a different build error (`Cannot find module '@/lib/utils'`) appeared on a different machine, we investigated the `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts` files. The user redirected the conversation back to the `ERESOLVE` error for a deeper discussion, where we explored the common reasons why the `legacy-peer-deps` configuration might not work as expected, focusing on configuration scope (`.npmrc` file location), stale `node_modules` or `package-lock.json` state, and potential npm cache issues.
