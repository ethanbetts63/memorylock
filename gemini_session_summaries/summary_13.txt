Session Summary: Mailgun Integration and Deliverability Troubleshooting

The primary objective of this session was to configure the Django application to send emails using Mailgun and ensure they were delivered to the user's inbox rather than being marked as spam.

We began by troubleshooting the DNS configuration for the sending subdomain, `mail.futurereminder.app`. This involved a multi-step process:
1.  Verifying all necessary DNS records in Mailgun (MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC).
2.  Identifying and correcting an issue where Cloudflare's proxy (orange cloud) was interfering with CNAME record verification. The solution was to set the CNAME records to "DNS only".
3.  Correcting the content of the DMARC record to ensure it was valid.

Despite all records being verified in Mailgun, test emails were still landing in the spam folder. Initial analysis incorrectly pointed towards a missing SPF record on the root domain. However, the user provided crucial email headers showing that the `From` address was correctly set to `postmaster@mail.futurereminder.app`.

This led to the correct diagnosis: the technical DNS setup was sound, but the `mail.futurereminder.app` subdomain was new and had no sending reputation (it was a "cold" domain). Email providers like Gmail treat emails from unknown domains with suspicion. The solution is a "warming up" process, which involves manually marking the emails as "not spam" for a period to build a positive reputation.

With the deliverability issue identified, we proceeded to integrate Mailgun into the application code:
1.  The `futurereminder/settings.py` file was updated to remove the previous Amazon SES configuration. New settings for the Mailgun API Key and sending domain were added. The `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` was updated to use the verified subdomain.
2.  The `notifications/email_services.py` file was refactored. The existing logic using Django's built-in `EmailMultiAlternatives` was replaced with a direct API call to Mailgun using the `requests` library. This provides more direct control and clearer error logging from the Mailgun API.

The project is now fully configured to send emails via Mailgun. The final step to ensure inbox placement is the non-technical "warming up" process.
